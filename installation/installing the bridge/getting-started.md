# Getting started

You've made it this far. Kendo and the aurelia-kendoui-bridge are now setup, but before you get started please read the following:

1. Read about the [conventions](https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/kendoui-bridge-docs/content/what_you_need_to_know.html#conventions) used by the bridge
2. Read about when to use `.bind` ([here](https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/kendoui-bridge-docs/content/what_you_need_to_know.html#when-to-bind-and-not-to-bind))
3. Go through [these samples](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo/#/samples/generic/)



** Need to point to documentation on how to load wrappers, or how to use .core(), .pro() or .detect() **
